# üè≠ Datamatrix Converter Web App üîß

<img src="icon-192.png" alt="App Icon" width="96"/>

This web application converts industrial datamatrix codes based on a predefined logic. It uses the device's camera to scan a datamatrix, processes the data, and generates a new datamatrix with the converted data.

This project is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, which means you can "install" it on your phone or desktop for easy access and an app-like experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** The core technologies for building the web application.
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Using a Manifest and Service Worker for installation and offline capabilities.
*   **@zxing/library:** A JavaScript library for decoding barcodes from images and video streams.
*   **bwip-js:** A JavaScript library for generating barcodes.

## üì¶ How to Use

1.  **Open the App:** Navigate to the application's URL in a modern web browser (like Chrome) on your phone or desktop.
2.  **Install the App (Recommended):** Look for a prompt or a button in your browser's menu to **"Install App"** or **"Add to Home Screen"**. This will create a shortcut for easy access.
3.  **Allow Camera Access:** The first time you use it, the app will ask for permission to use your camera.
4.  **Scan a Code:** Point the rear-facing camera at a datamatrix code.
5.  **Get Results:** The app will display the original and converted data, along with a new, scannable datamatrix.
6.  **Scan Again:** Click the "Scan Next" button to reset the app for the next scan.

## üóÉÔ∏è Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file.
*   `style.css`: The stylesheet for the application.
*   `script.js`: The main JavaScript file containing the application logic.
*   `database.json`: A file containing the reference keys and their multipliers.
*   `manifest.json`: The Web App Manifest file that makes the app installable.
*   `sw.js`: The Service Worker that enables offline functionality.
*   `icon-192.png` / `icon-512.png`: The application icons.

## üìà Managing the Database

You can easily add, edit, or remove reference data by modifying the `database.json` file. The file uses a simple key-value format:

```json
{
  "REFERENCE_KEY_1": MULTIPLIER_1,
  "REFERENCE_KEY_2": MULTIPLIER_2,
  "00C029CB01": 5
}
